The Big Hunt was one of my first major animation projects where I had to tell a story of my choosing. It was an independent project
that really put my animation skills and story telling skills to the test. I had to change my story to fit my time limit and 
not be overly ambitious. This project taught me how to manage time as well as the animation people.
