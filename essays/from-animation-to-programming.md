Ever since I was a kid, video games is something that has been a part of my life. I enjoyed playing video games and wanted to learn how to make one. I always saw the creative side video game development and only knew a small part of the technical end of it. When I got to UH Manoa, I wanted to dive into the animation and create the artistic side of games/animation. Because of COVID-19, I want to take the extra time to learn more about the technical side of it. 

After taking a class on game development during my time as a Creative Media major, I got to work with some ICS students who gave glimpses of developing software for a video game. I wanted to delve more into the backend aspects of it and see how coding goes hand-in-hand with the creative side of game development. I want to be able to be the bridge between animators and developers when I work in the video game industry, being able to go back and forth communicating with developers and artists.

As I am starting to take this software engineering class, Iâ€™m looking forward to learning how to work with others when working on writing code effectively. I want to make connections with my fellow classmates so in the future we can work together on bigger projects. I really hope to also see myself improve on programming and learning how to manage my time well when doing so.
