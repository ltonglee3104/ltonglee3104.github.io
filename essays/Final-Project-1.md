## Overview
*The Problem*: At UH Manoa there are ART and ACM majors who sometimes need to recruit people for major art an film projects but either need to
put out physical postings and spend money on printouts to try recruit people.

*The Solution*: ArtistCallUH is an application for Univerity of Hawaii students to allow project creators to put out their project listings and ask for help
as well as for students who are looking to participate in those projects. 

## Approach
When a user first lands at ArtistCallUH, they are greeted by a welcoming homepage with a login tab as well as a sign up tab. If a new user signs up for an account
they will be asked to fill out their name, major, a brief bio, a professional headshot, and if they are a project creator or someone who is looking to join a project.  

User profile fields will be accessable publicly on the website's pages, one for creators and one for participants. By clicking on an individual's profile,
it will take them to their biography page. The difference between the two different users is that the creator will have a list of projects that they need people
for the particpants will have a list of projects they are in.  

The two main usages of ArtistCallUH will be:

1. Allowing UH Students to view who are making projects and need help and who would be interested in participating in the art projects.
2. Allow easier access to projects and reduce resouces in doing casting calls, recruitment on projects, etc.

In Regards to the first usage of ArtistCallUH, particpants and creators will both have their information shown. For participants however, they have the option to try and contact
the creators and contact them directly through the website.

### Mockup Page Ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:

- Landing Page
- Creator Page
- Participant Page
- Projects Page
- Sign-up Page
- Admin Page

### New Case Ideas

- User goes to landing page, signs up for particpant page, creates user as participant.
- User goes to landing page, signs up for Creator page, creates user as creator (creates projects and lists them onsite).
- Admin logs in and manages what projects will be featured
- Visitors can go through project pages to see what is being worked on/ in production.  

### Beyond The Basics

- Feature completed projects from alumni
- React features that allow interaction on what projects are popular
- Application based messaging.
