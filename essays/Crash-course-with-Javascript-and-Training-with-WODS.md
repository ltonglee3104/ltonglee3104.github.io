## ES6 Dive into the Deep
Diving into ES6, the crash course into JavaScript was a mixture between brushing up on some language known from Java as well learning new features or changes of the language. In the first half of the ES6 module, it was a breeze as I was able to swim through each part of the module under 3 minutes each. Once I hit the half way mark, it took me a little longer to learn and understand the new features of JavaScript. Like learning a new stroke in swimming as I fumbled a few times and got hints before being able to complete the task. 
## Similarities to other Programs
JavasScript again, is very similar to Java in terms of writing formatting but with different requirements. When I working on some modules, I tripped up on some problems and got many syntax errors. Often, I had to refer to the tips and reread the module to understand what it wanted me to do. What will be a major adaption for me is the declaration of variables are slightly different from other languages I’ve learned and that might throw me off when programming. 
## Final Thoughts
After making a splash with the ES6 course, the WODs are challenging me to improve my technical skills as well as speed of writing code. The first few WODs were a good warmup to getting used to the rhythm of WODs problems. I’m expecting these to pick up in difficulty and speed to keep me conditioned. However, these WODs really stress me out as I want to try stay under the time limit but I’m worried that I’m not going to be proficient enough for these exercises. Hopefully I’ll be able to adapt to the consistent exercises and get into the rhythm. I’m definitely going to listen to some instrumental music when working on these WODs so I can reduce my stress and focus and the exercises.
